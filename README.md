# ⏳ Time-Bound NFT Ecosystem (ChronoNFT)

## 📝 Project Description

ChronoNFT is a dynamic NFT system that introduces time sensitivity and behavior-based evolution into non-fungible tokens. Unlike traditional NFTs, ChronoNFTs have lifecycles — from **Genesis** to **Decay** — that evolve over time based on the token's age and interaction. This makes NFTs feel alive and reactive, opening new doors for games, loyalty programs, and digital collectibles.

## 🌍 Project Vision

The goal of this project is to transform how NFTs behave by making them **time-aware**. By introducing lifecycle phases, NFT creators and developers can create collections that change over time, encourage interaction, or even expire. This introduces meaningful scarcity, gameplay mechanics, and utility tied to how users engage with their NFTs.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Lifecycle-Driven NFTs**  
  NFTs evolve through 4 distinct phases:  
  `Genesis → Growth → Prime → Decay`

- **Time-Based Logic**  
  NFTs track their own age using `block.timestamp` and automatically shift phase based on configurable timelines.

- **Conditional Burning**  
  NFTs can be destroyed when they reach the “Decay” phase, allowing for gamified self-destruction or rebirth mechanics.

- **Metadata Agnostic**  
  Each NFT holds a URI that can point to dynamic metadata that reflects its current phase (e.g., different art or traits).

- **Ownership Gated Minting**  
  Only the contract owner can mint NFTs, useful for curated drops or whitelist control.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- **Dynamic Metadata Refreshing**  
  Integrate with off-chain services (e.g., IPFS + server) to visually update NFT appearance based on phase.

- **On-Chain Resurrection Logic**  
  Add functionality to allow users to “revive” decayed NFTs with tokens or community votes.

- **Chainlink Oracle Integration**  
  Enable real-world events or off-chain activity (e.g., weather, price feeds) to impact NFT lifecycle.

- **Multi-Phase Utility Binding**  
  Assign different utilities or governance rights depending on NFT phase.

- **NFT-based Gameplay**  
  Create battle/strategy games where only NFTs in a certain phase are eligible for participation.
